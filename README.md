Website Development For Bitcloud

To Get Started, Fill out the survey: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1m-VO63sxyBMXEUzQOhHxv-VewguuprEx6yAIW7f2oQY/viewform


This website will act as both a means to spread the knowledge of bitcloud to the community, while also acting as a discussion base for the developrs of bitcloud.

There are decisions to be made about the language choice for the backend of the website.

The currently trending choices are:

- PHP
- CGI
- RAILS


What the website should have (feel free to change this, but this is what I had thought when writing this - SBSPIDER) :

Forum - so that we can shift our discussions away from mailing lists. Either using another framework, or creating our own         with features like notifications.

PR - We can use this as a front end to communicate to the community

Recruitment - As a means to recruit people for the team

Discussion / Chat system

Now, we can have two sides of the website - for the dev's and for the community.
The community part would, as mentioned before, act as a PR front end (e.g. linking to facebook and reddit), while the dev part could act like the Forum, discussion, recruitment etc, while also including things like the calender, links to the build server, code style guide, testing guide etc.
